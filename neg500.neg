Develop a media transcoding server that could provide assets like embedded fonts dynamically. I could see great benefit of developing a simple server that could use Flex's SWFKit to dynamically generate RSL SWFs for assets like embedded fonts at runtime. This would allow subsets of characters to be determined and requested at runtime so that the initial SWF did not have to embed an entire font, which is especially valuable for non-english scripts like Japanese etc.I could see other applications of such a media server that transcoded assets into SWF compatible ones on the fly. Photoshop transformations, localization, module update distribution. etc. etc. Task Develop a media transcoding server that could provide assets like embedded fonts dynamically.

Support for nested Menu's in PopUpMenuButton. Need a mechanism to support nested menu's in PopUpMenuButton. Popping up a nested menu is simple. However, once one selects a submenuitem from a nested Menu, clicking the PopUpMenuButton's main button should pass on the correct set of selectedIndex/Item, menu, subMenu's etc to the change handler. The restriction is that it can only provide those features that a menu can provide. Presently, there is no way to traverse all sub-menu's in a Menu. I am not sure if the recently introduced hierarchical collections is going to be used in Menu's. But once that is done, I would like that clicking the main button of PopUpMenuButton to behave the same way as clicking on a subMneuItem in a nested menu.

allow custom class in var-level Embed We should allow a custom class to be extended in var-level Embed so that the default type (SkinBitmap, etc) isn't always used. The custom class could be specified as an Embed parameter or as a configuration parameter.The most common use-case for this issue is when a user is creating an AS-only application that does not use the Flex framework. In this case the Skin* classes don't need to be used. A customer cab post says SkinBitmap increases a small AS testcase from 7 to 18KB.The workaround is to use class-level Embed when you want a specific class to be extended.Reproduction:1.2.3.Actual Results:Expected Results:Workaround: Improvement allow custom class in var-level Embed We should allow a custom class to be extended in var-level Embed so that the default type (SkinBitmap, etc) isn't always used.

RichTextEditor focus management has problems Actual Results:The controls of RTE toolbar set focus to the TextArea each time a control is used. This causes problems if the develop wants to programatically set focus on some other control.Also there is no easy way for the user to focus out of the RTE to some other control. The user would need to press Tab a couple of times and move through all the controls of the RTE to go to some other control.Expected Results: It should be easy to move focus out of RTE and write custom focus management code.Possibly a menu could be provided to change the formatting using the keyboard, and the ToolBar made non-focusable.

[old] Overlapping Windows [new] Provide control over stacking order and depth for components in an  Application I have now worked several customer incidents where customers want more control over the stacking order, or depth, of components. One incident involved Menus which poped *under* components displayed with the PopUpManager. Another incident involved a customer wanting to always keep a particular TitleWindow on top of all others. Still another involved popping a TitleWindow on top of other TitleWindows whenever the user clicks an element of the window.I suggest creating another layout manager, perhaps a "window manager" that allowed its children to have more fluid depth. Each child could be assigned either a specific depth (eg, always_on_top) or a dynamic depth, allowing any click within the child to bring it to the top (under the always_on_top child, of course).In this situation children could either be placed via (x,y) position or dragged about by the user as well as minimized and maximized.

[customer] There should be an ability to use environment variables in an Embed tag Another thing that might help is if you could use environment variables directly within your embed tags. So I could have something like Embed(source="%MY_ASSETS%/asset2.jpg").Environment variables would also help us with our source-paths themselves across different machines. The problem is that the project keeps the full path to the source-paths (C:\MySourcePath). With Perforce (I think you guys use this too), everyone has their own mapping from the repository to their local machines (different folders/drives). This makes it so that the real source-path is in different locations. So for projects that are checked in, we need to reset the source-path when we're ready to run them.

Suppress (optionally) warn logging  of EOF or Reset exceptions when remote socket is closed when a load-balancer or health check pings any transport connector endpoint to verify that the broker is listening on a port; using socket.open/close, any subsequent read failure is treated as an error and logged as a WARN.

AMQP: Set a default maxFrameSize for AMQP connections Currently the AMQP protocol head does not set a max AMQP frame size by default which means the default of a 4GB max frame size is assumed.  Due to recent changes in proton-j we can now more efficiently handle multi-framed deliveries and configure the broker to not send frames larger than a given size which makes handling of larger messages more efficient in some cases and allows the proton-j buffering to work in a more efficient manner than what it does by default.  Improvement AMQP: Set a default maxFrameSize for AMQP connections Currently the AMQP protocol head does not set a max AMQP frame size by default which means the default of a 4GB max frame size is assumed.

Preserve destination when browsing scheduled messages It is possible to browse scheduled messages by sending a message to ScheduledMessage.AMQ_SCHEDULER_MANAGEMENT_DESTINATION. Unfortunately (for us) the most interesting data is missing. SchedulerBroker#sendScheduledJob replaces the original destination from the scheduled message with the temporary destination of the client asking for the information. That is obviously necessary, but it means we can't figure out the final destination for the messages.We sometimes have thousands of messages and the broker cluster gets into trouble. We want to analyze the problem by checking how many messages there are for various destinations when this happens. At present that is difficult without changing the (many) posting systems to add headers.The solution is simple. Copy the original destination to a JMS property (schedulerOriginalDestination for example) before overwriting it. I will create a pull request.

Use a dynamic proxy in place of hand crafted read only objects for AMQP test client  Currently the AMQP test client uses hand crafted read-only wrappers around certain Proton objects returned from the client code to prevent a test from accidentally changing proton state outside the connection object's handler thread.  This is a bit cumbersome as these classes tend to need minor tweaks each time the proton library is updated.  We can instead use a proxy for the proton types generated on the fly to protect most of the proton code from being modified and not need to make changes on each version update.

Performance issue in PrioritizedPendingListIterator Sending and consuming 5000 messages to/from a queue, one can see heavy CPU use on the broker side (v 5.12.2).Yourkit shows PrioritizedPendingList$PrioritizedPendingListIterator.<init>as a hot spot method.

KahaDB: Allow rewrite of message acks in older logs which prevent cleanup There are cases where a chain of journal logs can grow due to acks for messages in older logs needing to be kept so that on recovery proper state can be restored and older messages not be resurrected.

Improve nio transport scalability NIO transport uses unbounded thread pool executor to handle read operation. Under large number of connections and load, this could lead to large number of threads and eventually OOM errors. Which is the exact problem that nio transport is supposed to solve. Some work has been done in [AMQ-5480], to make this configurable, but there's still more work to make it more robust. Creating a fixed thread pool with a queue in front gives much better results in my tests.Additionally, the same thread pool is used for accepting connections ([AMQ-5269]). This can lead to the broker not being able to accept new connections under the load. I got much better results when experimenting with implementing acceptor logic directly and handling it in the same thread (without reintroducing the old problem). With these two improvements in place, the broker accept and handle the number of connections up to the system limits.

Improve performance of virtual topic fanout Virtual topics provide a nice alternative to durable subs. Each durable sub is modeled as a separate queue.There are performance implications however, because a message has to be sent to each of the (fanout) queues. For a durable subs, there is a single message in the journal and just index updates for each sub.To improve performance there are three ways to improve the comparison between virtual topics and durable subs.   # avoid the disk sync associated with enqueue   # do parallel enqueues to get the store batching writes   # introduce message references in the journal to reduce the disk ioFor 1, introducing a transaction (either client side or automatically, broker side) ensures there is a single disk sync on commit.For 2, using an executor to do sends in parallel allows the journal to batch as seen in AMQ-5077For 3, the implementation is a lot more involved; for recovery there needs to be a journal write per destination and reading the journal will require two reads because of the indirection. Tracking gc needs to be handled to ensure the referenced entry is maintained. In short this is a lot of work and will only be visible for large (> 8k) messages where the cost of a large v small journal write is noticeable. The messageId dataLocator provides an entry point for this work but considering that 1 & 2 combined can give a 3x improvement I don't think it is worth the effort (and added complexity) at the moment.

AMQP: Broker should use 'JMS' transformer by default Currently the AMQP transportConnector uses the "NATIVE" transformer by default which limits the interoperability of AMQP client's and client's using other protocols as the messages they'd receive sent from any AMQP connection would be a BytesMessage with the unconverted AMQP message as the payload.By using the JMS transformer as the default we allow AMQP to interoperate just like all the other client connectors attempt to do.  Issues that existed previously with the JMS transformer have been pretty well ironed out now and most all AMQP features work even when using this transformer.

AMQP: Allow delivery transformer to fallback to lower level transformer when transformation fails If a client sends an AMQP that cannot be transformed using the configured transformer the broker shouldn't drop the message, instead it should attempt to fall-back to a less aggressive transformer.  An example would be a broker configured to use the JMS transformer and the incoming message contains a body consisting of a DescribedType.  The JMS Transformer would fail as there is no direct way to map that into a JMS message type.  We could in this case fallback to the Native transformer and still process the message.  An OpenWire client for instance would just receive a BytesMessage while other AMQP clients would get the message in the form it was sent.This allows the message to round-trip for instance from AMQP -> OpenWire -> OpenWire -> AMQP (Broker network bridge) without losing its original payload or message properties.

We currently don't honor the flow values sent from a receiver to indicate how many messages our sender can produce (prefetch) and always maintain a fixed value based either on a transport configuration option or the first non-zero flow.  This is however not in keeping with how the credit model is expected to work in AMQP and leads to some issues with the brokers sender accepting messages and buffering them until the receiver sends a flow thereby preventing those messages from being dispatched to another receiver subscribed to the same destination.  We need to honor the link credit and only dispatch when the receiver indicates it is willing to take messages by sending more link credit.

Add safety measure against infinite loop when store exception prevents message removal When the broker is configured with a database store, the "purge" operation enters an infinite loop when the message removal operation fails, for instance when the broker datasource is being restarted (see example stack trace below). Here is a patch which adds a safety measure, in case the "dequeue" count of the queue does not increase between 2 messages removal operations.  The check is not garanteed to detect the problem on the next iteration, because a business consumer might also be dequeuing messages from the queue.  But the "purge" is probably much faster than the business consumer, so if it fails to remove 2 messages in a row, it is enough to detect the problem and abort the infinite loop.{code}2015-03-05 15:38:30,353 | WARN  | 14571659-2202099 |  | JDBCPersistenceAdapter           | Could not get JDBC connection: Data source is closedjava.sql.SQLException: Data source is closed	at org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource.createDataSource(BasicDataSource.java:1362)	at org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource.getConnection(BasicDataSource.java:1044)	at org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.TransactionContext.getConnection(TransactionContext.java:58)	at org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.adapter.DefaultJDBCAdapter.getStoreSequenceId(DefaultJDBCAdapter.java:285)	at org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.JDBCPersistenceAdapter.getStoreSequenceIdForMessageId(JDBCPersistenceAdapter.java:787)	at org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.JDBCMessageStore.removeMessage(JDBCMessageStore.java:194)	at org.apache.activemq.store.memory.MemoryTransactionStore.removeMessage(MemoryTransactionStore.java:358)	at org.apache.activemq.store.memory.MemoryTransactionStore$1.removeAsyncMessage(MemoryTransactionStore.java:166)	at org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue.acknowledge(Queue.java:846)	at org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue.removeMessage(Queue.java:1602)	at org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue.removeMessage(Queue.java:1594)	at org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue.removeMessage(Queue.java:1579)	at org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue.purge(Queue.java:1158)	at org.apache.activemq.broker.jmx.QueueView.purge(QueueView.java:54){code} Improvement Add safety measure against infinite loop when store exception prevents message removal When the broker is configured with a database store, the "purge" operation enters an infinite loop when the message removal operation fails, for instance when the broker datasource is being restarted (see example stack trace below).

AMQP - delayed authentication from SASL connect leads to race on client end. We currently delay checking the credentials provided during the SASL negotiation and also checking if anonymous client connects are legal until after opening the proton connection and then we send an error condition indicating the failure and close the connection.  This can lead to a race on the client end where it looks for a breif moment in time that the connection succeeded.  During that time the client might attempt some further action and then fail in an odd way as the connection is closed under it.  We should look into authenticating immediately and failing the SASL handshake if not authorized.  We should also consider whether we want to support raw connections with a SASL handshake as well since without at least a SASL ANONYMOUS handshake we can get back into this issue unless we just forcibly close the socket on a client if we don't support anonymous connections.

Support for anonymous style producers in AMQP Current AMQP implementation doesn't provide a way to implement efficient anonymous producers.  The QPid JMS client for instance opens a new producer instance for each destination that the anonymous producer sends to.  To more efficiently handle anonymous producers we should provide a configurable node name (default as $relay) which would use the to feild of the incoming message to decide where the message is to be sent.

Destination should not have numerical suffix for single-dest perf tests The performance test module assumes that multiple destinations will be put under load, and thereby assigns a numerical suffix to the destination name specified on the command line. Thus a producer/consumer configured to topic://foo will actually send/receive from topic://foo.0. This is annoying, as when load testing a particular broker setup (such as with composite destinations), you need to be explicit about which destination is being targeted and it is not always possible to tweak the broker configuration.I propose that for single-destination tests, no numerical suffix is added.

Failover Transport timeout option causes connection failures in some cases where it shouldn't Originally added in AMQ-2061 the timeout option is used to cause a send of Message that's gone out async to fail if the connection doesn't come back in some amount of time.  The problem is that the option is currently applied to everything that goes through FailoverTransport oneway() and this can cause a Connection start where the broker is not up to fail regardless of the maxReconnectAttempts or startupMaxReconnectAttempts value configured for the transport. We need to refine the timeout logic to only apply to Message instances and not to other commands like ConnectionInfo so that a Connection start honors the normal failover transport reconnect configuration logic.

Switch to using Proton's Event logic for detecting AMQP state changes We currently use a polling model to detect state changes in the proton engine when new data arrives.

AbortSlow*ConsumerStrategy with abortConnection=false; ensure consumers are always removed from the broker  If a consumer is slow and a candidate to abort, the broker sends a control command to the consumer. However there is no guarantee that the consumer will respond to the command and close. As a result the consumer can remain longer than necessary and possibly indefinitely.,The broker needs to follow up with a local removeInfo  that will force the removal from the broker so that inflight messages can get eagerly redispatched.The client can eventually shut down the client view of the consumer but the broker will be able to continue regardless.

Improve performance of composite topic fanout and persistent asyncSend We have publishers publishing to a topic which has 5 topic -> queue routings, and gets a max message rate attainable of ~833 messages/sec, with each message around 5k in size.To test this i set up a JMS config with topic queues:TopicTopicRouted.1...TopicRouted.11Each topic has an increasing number of routings to queues, and a client is set up to subscribe to all the queues.Rough message rates:routings messages/sec0 25001 14282 20003 14284 11115 833This occurs whether the broker config has producerFlowControl="false" set to true or false , and KahaDB disk synching is turned off. We also tried experimenting with concurrentStoreAndDispatch, but that didn't seem to help. LevelDB didn't give any notable performance improvement either.We also have asyncSend enabled on the producer, and have a requirement to use persistent messages. We have also experimented with sending messages in a transaction, but that hasn't really helped.It seems like producer throughput rate across all queue destinations, all connections and all publisher machines is limited by something on the broker, through a mechanism which is not producer flow control. I think the prime suspect is still contention on the index.We did some test with Yourkit profiler.Profiler was attached to broker at startup, allowed to run and then a topic publisher was started, routing to 5 queues. Profiler statistics were reset, the publisher allowed to run for 60 seconds, and then profiling snapshot was taken. During that time, ~9600 messages were logged as being sent for a rate of ~160/sec.This ties in roughly with the invocation counts recorded in the snapshot (i think) - ~43k calls. From what i can work out, in the snapshot (filtering everything but org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb), For the 60 second sample period, 24.8 seconds elapsed in org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.KahaDbTransactionStore$1.removeAsyncMessage(ConnectionContext, MessageAck).18.3 seconds elapsed in org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.KahaDbTransactionStore$1.asyncAddQueueMessage(ConnectionContext, Message, boolean).From these, a further large portion of the time is spent inside MessageDatabase:org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase.process(KahaRemoveMessageCommand, Location) - 10 secs elapsedorg.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase.process(KahaAddMessageCommand, Location) - 8.5 secs elapsed.As both of these lock on indexLock.writeLock(), and both take place on the NIO transport threads, i think this accounts for at least some of the message throughput limits. As messages are added and removed from the index one by one, regardless of sync type settings, this adds a fair amount of overhead. While we're not synchronising on writes to disk, we are performing work on the NIO worker thread which can block on locks, and could account for the behaviour we've seen client side. To Reproduce:1. Install a broker and use the attached configuration.2.

Add new mode to JMS Pool that allows for not caching producers The current JMS Pool creates a single anonymous producer instance for all requests to create a Producer.  In some cases a user might want to have a separate producer instance created for each requestor.

Change MIME type for XML in the REST API According to RFC 3023, "if an XML document is readable by casual users, text/xml is preferable to application/xml. MIME user agents (and web user agents) that do not have explicit support for text/xml will treat it as text/plain, for example, by displaying the XML MIME entity as plain text. Application/xml is preferable when the XML MIME entity is unreadable by casual users".Several other projects supported by Red Hat (Drools, Infinispan, OpenShift) already comply with this RFC.

Avoid unnecessary remainder operator for floating-point I installed jdk-7u45-linux-arm-vfp-sflt.tar.gz on my pandaboard, and found that this jdk has a problem of remainder operator for floating point. So, if you starts ActiveMQ in above environment, you might encounter IndexOutOfBoundsException at  org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport.getConnectList(FailoverTransport.java:779)This is because  int p = (int) (Math.random() * 100 % l.size());above p gets larger number than "l.size" contrary to your expectation. This problem doesn't occur in case of x86 Architecture or ARM Hardfloat JDK.This is a problem of ARM Softfloat JDK, but I think it's better to avoid unnecessary remainder operator for floating-point for safety. So,   int p = ((int) Math.random() * 100) % l.size();would be better than current one.

ActiveMQ in standalone mode - Have it output the urls for web consoles and JMX When you start ActiveMQ in standalone mode, you can see something about Web console type embedded etc. But you cannot see what the http url is for accessing the console. It would be great if we could add a log to point people to a http url to access. For example if 8161 port is used they can access the welcome page athttp://localhost:8161/And we should possible make the welcome page non secure, so they do not need to login to see that page. As the links on that welcome page points to the embedded consoles which is secure.

KahaDB default checksumJournalFiles to true A checksum allows us to validate and ignore missing/corrupt journal files (both of which are optional).

Provide a polling SlowConsumerPolicy that uses LastAck time on a sub The existing AbortSlowConsumer policy is event driven. It depends on a consumer slow event that is triggered when the prefetch is reached and there are subsequent dispatches.With prefetch=0|1 there still needs to be throughput to determine that the consumer is slow so one message can be pending if there are no new messages to sent to the destination.Providing an alternative implementation that will periodically poll consumers for their last ack time will be more deterministic. The slow advisory may never fire, but the consumer will get aborted if it does not ack in a timely manner.if lastAckTime exceeds the max and there are dispatched messages it can be a candidate for removal.Optionally lastAckTime exceeding and no dispatched messages can be a way to remove idle consumers. Not sure if that is necessary. Improvement Provide a polling SlowConsumerPolicy that uses LastAck time on a sub The existing AbortSlowConsumer policy is event driven.

network connectors - new messageTTL and consumerTTL - split usage of networkTTL for mesh topology currently networkTTL in a networkConnector (default=1) means that a message can go one hop and demand (or info about a consumer) can go one hop.In a network (A<>B) messages and consumers can flow.In a linear network (A<>B<>C) networkTTL needs to be 2 for messages and consumers to flow two hops from A to C.In a mesh topology, (A<>B<>C<A>) a networkTTL=1 for consumers makes sense because there is at most one hop. However for messages, networkTTL > 1 is necessary if consumers need to hop around between brokers. Imagine a consumer on A which pulls messages to A from B, then the consumer moves to C, messages now need to hop again from A to C. This can repeat, essentially messageTTL(networkTTL) needs to be infinite.With consumerTTL > 1 in a mesh, managing demand for proxy (demand) consumers and proxy proxy consumers becomes very difficult.

ActiveMQ <systemUsage> configuration.

ERROR | Temporary Store limit is 0 mb, whilst the max journal file size for the temporary store is: 32 mb, the temp store will not accept any data when used. As it is not possible to specify only the "memoryUsage" limit and other two can get the default values, because as the defaults are provided when there is no explicit systemUsage element and via xbean the default creation method does not set a limit so it needs to be explicitly set.I guess it would make for a nice simple enhancement if it take default for remaining.Thank, Krishna.

Messages with AMQ_SCHEDULED_DELAY do not respect transactions Currently delayed messages are delivered even if the session it was sent in is rolled back. According to http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/AMQ-SCHEDULED-DELAY-and-transactional-boundaries-td4658339.html this is because the message can be delivered far in the future and the transaction would take to long.I don't agree with that argument.

The delivery to the consumer is not part of the transaction anymore.e.g. consider the scenario in the following preudo code:    while (application_runs)    try{        msg = session.Receive();        session.SendDelayed(anotherMessage);        if (random(5) != 0) throw exception;        session.Commit();    } catch { session.Rollback; }Currently a delayed message is sent for each retry.

PooledConnectionFactory should track Session checkouts and close associated resources When the user's code closes a Connection checked out from the pool, I would expect activemq-pool to close Sessions, MessageConsumers and MessageProducers that were created from it. Unfortunately, activemq-pool only cleans up Sessions on Connection.close() when no one else is referencing the Connection (referenceCount == 0). This makes Sessions, Consumers and Producers outlive the code that actually uses them, thus leading to increased resource consumption and messages being trapped in prefetch buffers that are no longer monitored.Instead, we should keep track of the Sessions that were created from each specific Connection checkout, and close them when the borrowed Connection is closed.Otherwise we bump into situations like [SPR-10092|https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10092] when using Spring's DefaultMessageListenerContainer. In some cases DMLC "forgets" to explicitly close MessageConsumers and Sessions, even though Connections are always closed, but the pool doesn't take care of cleaning up associated sessions.

Expose Destination.setMemoryUsage so that custom policies can override default MemoryUsage (e.g., to specify message count limits) Using queues as an example, but this also applies to topics...When a queue is created, it inherits the System-wide (broker) usage manager and its limits.

Job Scheduler Store Growth is Unrestricted When using scheduled delivery, it is possible to grow the job scheduler store indefinitely.  As no quota can be set on the size of this store, a malfunctioning, malicious, or prodigious producer can easily consume all available storage with scheduled messages without any alerts being raised by the broker.  If the operators do not have disk space monitoring in place outside of the broker, the broker can become innoperable without warning.Provide a mechanism to set a usage quota for the job scheduler store.

Add support for java 7 in AbstractJmxCommand In the class org.apache.activemq.console.command.AbstractJmxCommand the method  isSunJVM() checks wether the JVM is from Sun or not. This is done by comparing the system property "vendor" with the hardcoded string "Sun Microsystems Inc.". This prevents using the PID for connecting to the JVM via JMX locally when using java 7 because the vendor string is "Oracle Corporation".A possible bugfix is to enhance the method like this:public static boolean isSunJVM() {        return (getJVM().equals("Sun Microsystems Inc.") ||                 getJVM().equals("Oracle Corporation"));} Improvement Add support for java 7 in AbstractJmxCommand In the class org.apache.activemq.console.command.AbstractJmxCommand the method  isSunJVM() checks wether the JVM is from Sun or not.

Refactor logic to shutdown thread pools using a single API to ensure better shutdown and offer logging et all In Apache Camel we have a centralized API for thread pools. This allows us to track this in Camel, and ensure thread pools is enlisted in JMX, and also unregistered again. As well having logs when thread pools is created / shutdown etc. Also better logic for shutdown graceful and then fallback to be aggressive etc. And to add a thread factory, that offers a naming pattern style, so end users can customize thread naming etc.In activemq-core, there is pieces of logic for that. We should tidy this up, and especially ensure shutdown is happening consistent and more graceful, etc.This can help make it possible to do as Camel to also enlist thread pools in JMX.

Make better use of commons-pool in activemq-pool Currently activemq-pool uses only a tiny portion of the functionality that's available in commons-pool opting instead to reinvent a lot of things that now exists there such as keyed object pools.  We can refactor the current codebase to better use common-pool.  This allows for easily adding features like enabling async checks for Connections that have idled out and removing them from the pool as well as adding more diagnostic methods to our API and using a well tested pooling backend instead of our own custom code.

Refactor IntrospectionSupport to avoid using java bean property editors Java bean property editors is slow and not thread safe to use. We at Apache Camel has removed its usage in the Camel type converter system.We should do the same in ActiveMQ. There is only a number of default converters needed that is fairly easy to implement by hand (eg String <-> Numbers, Booleans etc.). This fixes some other issues with AMQ causing memory leaks in dynamic environments where you may run multiple brokers, or hot deploy brokers.

ActiveMQ should support multiple durable subscriptions per Stomp client This is coming from AMQ-3802.Quoting Timothy - "This is another limitation of the Stomp support which allows for only one durable subscription since clientId and subscription name are linked. This is because the Stomp v1.0 spec didn't require that you assign unique Ids to subscriptions, so the correlation is made per connection using the matching clientId and subscription name. You can work around this by creating a connection for each durable subscriber."Now, since ActiveMQ v5.6.0 supports Stomp v1.1 which has made the id header mandatory for subscribe and unsubscribe calls, we should leverage this feature and allow for multiple durable subscriptions per stomp client. Hacks like creating a separate connection for each durable subscriber should be avoided.Let me know if you have any queries?Thanks,Bhanu New Feature ActiveMQ should support multiple durable subscriptions per Stomp client This is coming from AMQ-3802.Quoting Timothy - "This is another limitation of the Stomp support which allows for only one durable subscription since clientId and subscription name are linked.

Stomp Spec allows for stomp headers to have spaces in key or value we currently trim. The spec specification allows for spaces to exists at either end of a message header key or value.  We currently trim the header keys in order to be forgiving of clients that don't adhere to the this and send odd keys with space padding, we should now stop this and align more closely to spec compliant behavior.  This means some clients could see some oddness if they don't also ensure that keys we are looking for like 'destination' etc are not correctly formated on send.

Add support for Broker based redelivery redelivery is handled by the consumer, so client side. messages pending redelivery are seen as inflight by the broker and not available to other consumers. It is possible to break the order constraint and receive messages backed up behind a message pending redelivery, but this is all local to the client consumer.When redelivery is exhausted, the message is returned to the broker with a poison ack, which the broker responds by removing the message and doing Dead letter queue processing (DLQ).This enhancement will allow a replacement of DLQ handling that will handle redelivery. It is based on the ideas outlined and implemented by a camel route in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2710 The idea is a BrokerPlugin will override sendToDeadLetterQueue and resend the message to the original destination in accordance with a matching RedeliveryPolicy. The resend will use the broker schedular to implement the delayed send after the message has been acked as poison by the consumer.So the message will essentially be enqueued at the tail of the queue and dispatched again to any available consumer.If retries are exceeded or there is no matching redelivery policy for a destination, normal DLQ processing will take place.This will work in conjunction with consumer/client redelivery exhaustion or using a redelivery policy in the url query of jms.redeliveryPolicy.maximumRedeliveries=0 New Feature Add support for Broker based redelivery redelivery is handled by the consumer, so client side. messages pending redelivery are seen as inflight by the broker and not available to other consumers.

Hybrid Master Slave Architecture Hi,Can we have a Hybrid Master Slave Architecture where in we can merge the functionalities of pure master slave and shared file system master slave.Basically, we have a disaster recovery requirement wherein we want to simulataneously run three brokers. A master broker will serve all the client requests, a slave broker at the same site on a different host will try to acquire the lock on kahadb(a typical slave). And we need a third broker to run at a *different site* which should fully replicate the state of the current master. This slave host should only be started when both the master and first slave are down.Can we do it with the current ActiveMQ transports/configurations or this will need enhancements.Please let me know if you have any queries regarding this.Thanks,Bhanu Improvement Hybrid Master Slave Architecture Hi,Can we have a Hybrid Master Slave Architecture where in we can merge the functionalities of pure master slave and shared file system master slave.Basically, we have a disaster recovery requirement wherein we want to simulataneously run three brokers.

Use 1G heap by default and UseDedicatedTaskRunner=false, more production ready -Xmx1G and -Xms1G is more production ready as folks tend to leave the defaults in place.-Dorg.apache.activemq.UseDedicatedTaskRunner=true made sense for small numbers of connections and for earlier versions of the broker that used fewer thread pools.With the current impl, sharing threads makes more sense by default, so -Dorg.apache.activemq.UseDedicatedTaskRunner=false (the default) is preferable.
