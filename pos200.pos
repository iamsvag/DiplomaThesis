SwcDynamicArchive hangs onto large ByteArrayOutputStream representing compiled swc When the user compiles a swc, the swc's binary contents are kept in memory after the compile, in a variable that is never used again.  This is a memory leak; that variable should be nulled out after it has been used.The class SwcDynamicArchive can be (optionally) passed an OutputStream when it is constructed.  Later, when someone calls SwcDynamicArchive.save(), if an OutputStream was passed in, then the swc is written to that OutputStream.  However, the OutputStream is still in the SwcDynamicArchive (in the member variable "out").This is used by Library.link() (among other places), which passes in a ByteArrayOutputStream; and the SwcDynamicArchive is never released (it goes into the SwcCache).  As a result, the ByteArrayOutputStream with the entire contents of the swc is never freed.  In the case of large swcs, this can add up to a lot of memory.A quick and easy fix would be to modify SwcDynamicArchive.save() so that it sets the "out" field to null.  A cleaner, but slightly more involved, fix would be to change SwcDynamicArchive() so that instead of passing the OutputStream in the constructor, it is passed as an argument to the save() function.The "steps to reproduce" below are very time-consuming if you aren't already familiar with the process of capturing and analyzing memory snapshots, so I don't expect QE to necessarily follow these steps; the problem can be observed more easily by just studying the compiler code.Steps to reproduce:1. In Flash Builder, compile any Flex library project2. use jmap (on the Mac) or JConsole (on Windows) to create a memory snapshot3. Open the memory snapshot in Eclipse's MAT (memory analyzer tool)4. Click Histogram, then filter on ".*SwcDynamicArchive"5. Right-click > List objects > with outgoing references6. In the new tab that opens, expand the SwcDynamicArchive, then expand its "out" member  Actual Results:You will see that the "buf" member is a buffer whose contents are equal to the swc on disk.  Expected Results:"buf" should be null (or should not exist at all).

List.purgeMeasuringRenderers() des not clear the measuringObjects Dictionary The code for mx:List in both SDK 3.4 and SDK 4.0 is:    mx_internal function purgeMeasuringRenderers():void    {        var item:IListItemRenderer;        for each (item in measuringObjects)            if (item.parent)                item.parent.removeChild(DisplayObject(item));        if (!measuringObjects)            measuringObjects = new Dictionary(true);    }In the last "if" clause, a new Dictionary is created only if measuringObject is null.

In ASDoc, @copy won't work if it's placed at the beginning of the ASDoc I view this as a pretty big deal.

ASDoc for moduleFactory showing up in Skin's MXML files as "overridden" Generate ASDoc files using "ant asdoc".  In Skin files you'll see:moduleFactory : IFlexModuleFactory[override]  You shouldn't see that.  This override gets generate by the compiler and that should be ASDoced as "@private". I talked to Paul about it, and we think the issue is that ImplementationGenerator.generatemoduleFactoryPropertyOverride() should call AbstractSyntaxTreeUtil.generatePrivateDocComment().I'm not sure why this isn't showing up on the river ASDoc builds--the doc guys think it might be because the compiler code hasn't been updated in a while.  However, I'm definitely seeing it when I generate the docs myself, so I think it's a bug we should fix.

Xml response incorrectly parsing ArrayCollections. Steps to reproduce:1. Expose the attached "product.xml" file as a response to a http request (you can use the attached project, it loads the file from filesystem but the result is the same).2. Check the "images" property of the generated ObjectProxy. It should be an array (contains only children of the same type), but it's a wrapper and the real array is in the nested property with the name of any children.3. If you try to map the xml to an object with a "images" attribute of type ArrayCollection, you'll notice that the real array is put in the first element of the "images" ArrayCollection (that would have only one element anyway).  Actual Results:result.images.productImage is ArrayCollection "images" is an ObjectProxy containing a property with the name of the first object, that contains the real ArrayCollection.It seems that sometimes everything works correctly, but in the attached case the error is always reproduced.  Expected Results: result.images is ArrayCollectionEither an xml element containing a list of same type children is mapped directly as ArrayCollection, or there should be a way to force/declare this.  Workaround (if any): As in the code attached, you can test the type of the proxied array and act accordingly. For every array received.  As a side note, I have to say that the same behaviour (the real array inserted in the first element) happened a few time even with SOAP calls, but unfortunately at the moment I can't get a simple example that has always this behaviour.

Invalid "null" Number passed in web service calls. Steps to reproduce:1. Use wizard to create a Data/Service connection to the attached wsdl (any wsdl with a Number parameter passed will do).2. Call the web service without inizialing the number passed.  Actual Results:   <SOAP-ENV:Body>    <tns:getNumber xmlns:tns="http://example.com/">      <tns:arg0>NaN</tns:arg0>    </tns:getNumber>  </SOAP-ENV:Body>The web service call contains the string NaN where the wsdl states a numeric type (long in the example attached).

setLayoutBoundsSize() sometimes incorrectly sets the width to 0 This bug is causing problems for Catalyst. There are 2 related issues...*** Problem #1 ***1. Run the attached application2. Click "set rotation".3. Click "Button"Result: nothing happens. This is the expected behavior.4. Run the app again5. Click "rotate around center"6. Click "Button"Result: the button shrinks really small. This should not happen.I think this is a bug in setLayoutBoundsSize(), the button should not shrink really small in step 6.Workaround: in the MXML file, I added some code in rotateAroundPt() to force very small values in the matrix to be zero instead. This makes Problem #1 go away.*** Problem #2 ***1. In Flash Builder, put a breakpoint in setRotation(), on the line that says "put breakpoint here".2. Run this app in the debugger3. Click "set rotation"4. When you arrive at the breakpoint, go to the Variables panel, and open up "this.button.[inherited].transform.matrix"5. Go from the breakpoint6. Click "Button"Result: the button shrinks really small.The only difference from steps 1-3 above is that we stopped at the breakpoint and looked at the member variables of the button.

Basically, the parts of skins (like the 'scroller' part on TextArea) are not bindable, so you can't refer to those parts in MXML code. This makes it difficult to, for example, set up effects that animate based on the values of these properties.There doesn't seem to be a performance problem with making these parts [Bindable]; the only performance issue comes in using the binding (so it's pay-as-you-go).Here's an example app that should work if the scroller part of TextArea were bindable. As it is, the animations do nothing because it isn't bindable. (Note the alternate commented-out buttons that call a script function to make the animations work, but the idea is to make it possible for declarative animations to do the job instead). There are plenty of other parts that should be [Bindable] as well - this example only covers the TextArea.scroller case). To see the problem, click the two buttons and notice ... nothing. The animations don't run. To see what the effect should be, uncomment the Button declarations that call scrollTo() and run it again.<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><s:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"                xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"                xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/halo" minWidth="1024" minHeight="768">    <fx:Script>        <![CDATA[            import spark.effects.Animate;            import spark.effects.animation.Keyframe;            import spark.effects.animation.MotionPath;            private function scrollTo(endPosition:Number):void            {                var anim:Animate = new Animate(textArea.scroller.viewport);                anim.motionPaths = new <MotionPath>[                    new MotionPath("verticalScrollPosition")];                anim.motionPaths[0].keyframes = new <Keyframe>[                    new Keyframe(0), new Keyframe(500, endPosition)];                anim.play();            }        ]]      >    </fx:Script>        <fx:Declarations>        <s:Animate id="animateScrollEnd" target="{textArea.scroller.viewport}">            <s:SimpleMotionPath property="verticalScrollPosition" valueTo="{textArea.scroller.viewport.contentHeight}"/>        </s:Animate>        <s:Animate id="animateScrollHome" target="{textArea.scroller.viewport}">            <s:SimpleMotionPath property="verticalScrollPosition" valueTo="0"/>        </s:Animate>    </fx:Declarations>            <s:VGroup>        <!--<s:Button label="Scroll To Top" click="scrollTo(0)"/>        <s:Button label="Scroll To End"                   click="scrollTo(textArea.scroller.viewport.contentHeight)"/>-->        <s:Button label="Scroll To Top" click="animateScrollHome.play()"/>        <s:Button label="Scroll To End"                   click="animateScrollEnd.play()"/>    </s:VGroup>    <s:TextArea id="textArea" x="50" y="60" width="160" height="200"                text=                "This is the first day of the rest of my life, which                makes yesterday the end of the previous part of my life                and tomorrow the second day of the rest of my life.

soap response incorrectly decoded by XMLDecoder I used the FB4 "Connect to web service" option to generate wrappers for a simple web service.  The soap response is sent and received and misinterpreted by the XMLDecoder class.  I'm not sure if I've got the correct Component (or even Project), but it looks to me like an SDK problem.I'm including the wsdl and the soap send and response for a simple webservice that adds two numbers.  Hopefully this makes the problem reproducible.  The issue appears to be that the mx.rpc.xml.XMLDecoder class unpacks simple types, but at the point where getSimpleValue() is called, 'value' has already been transformed to the raw data (in this case '5').  However, in the getSimpleValue and getValue methods, the 'value' (revealingly passed in with the parameter name 'parent') is expected to be XML or XMLList or a ContentProxy.  So the raw data is right there in the input parameter, but the code falls through all of the cases and returns a result of 'undefined'.  Steps to reproduce:1.

The soap response is sent and received and misinterpreted by the XMLDecoder class.  I'm not sure if I've got the correct Component (or even Project), but it looks to me like an SDK problem.I'm including the wsdl and the soap send and response for a simple webservice that adds two numbers.  Hopefully this makes the problem reproducible.  The issue appears to be that the mx.rpc.xml.XMLDecoder class unpacks simple types, but at the point where getSimpleValue() is called, 'value' has already been transformed to the raw data (in this case '5').  However, in the getSimpleValue and getValue methods, the 'value' (revealingly passed in with the parameter name 'parent') is expected to be XML or XMLList or a ContentProxy.  So the raw data is right there in the input parameter, but the code falls through all of the cases and returns a result of 'undefined'.  Steps to reproduce:1. In FlashBuilder 4, use 'Connect to web service' to generate code from the wsdl2. write a simple UI to pass two numbers to the web service3. observe that the data in the 'Sum' object is always "NaN" (the marshallBuiltInType() method converts "undefined" double to the 'not a number' value).

IME candidate list pops up in inconsistent location when the input field is in a popup Steps to reproduce:1. Build the attached app and run it in a 10.1 Player (needs 10.1 for in-line IME support).2. Put focus into the edit field, change the IME to Japanese/Hiragana mode, and press the 'a' key a few times.3. Press the spacebar twice to show the candidate list. Note the list's location.4. Use the sliders to change the edit field's position and repeat steps 2 and 3.5. Delete all the text in the text field, change the edit field's position, and repeat steps 2 and 3.  Actual Results: The position of the candidate list relative to the text field is inconsistent. If you delete the text in the field before moving the field, position of the candidate list appears to shift to the right and downward away from the text field proportionally to how far the text field is from the upper-left corner of the window. If you don't delete the text in the field before moving it, the candidate list will sometimes (not always) appear in its old position.  Expected Results: The candidate list should always appear next to or below the text field.

osmf.swc needs to specify XML namespace prefix other than "layout" I think osmf.swc may need a Flex manifest, to specify an appropriate XML namespace prefix.  Currently, it seems to be defaulting to "layout", which is confusing.Steps to reproduce:1. In Flash Builder, create a new Flex project2. Try to change the layout of the application to vertical.  The way to do this is by inserting <s:layout><s:VerticalLayout/></s:layout>, so try to do this by typing "<lay" and waiting for code hints to fill in the rest.  Actual Results:A bunch of other Strobe-related stuff shows up with "layout:" as its XML namespace prefix, but "s:layout" is way down near the bottom of the list.  Expected Results:It is common in code view to want to set the layout with <s:layout>, so it would be nice if this were higher up; also, "layout:" seems like an unusual XML prefix for Strobe to use.  So I think osmf.swc should probably have a Flex manifest to specify a different prefix.

RTE in Label when maxDisplayedLines, right and left properties are all set on a Label component.

AIR 2.0 and Flex 4 SDK recent builds = not working (From Greg Wilson)Attached is a simple HelloWorld app.  If I compile it with a recent Flex 4 SDK, it will NOT run on the current AIR 2.0 build on the prerelease site.   The app shows up in the list of running processes but nothing appears.  I have to kill it from task manager.  I had the same results for Flex SDK builds 11810, 11824 and 11873.HOWEVER, if I build it using Flex SDK build 10485 (beta2), it runs just fine on both AIR 1.5.x and AIR 2.0 from the pre-release site.Since many Flex 4 developers are pulling nightly builds from the pre-release site, they are going to have issues with running the resulting AIR app on AIR 2.0 beta.The problem occurs with both Windows and Mac OS.Greg WilsonAttached is my Flex project and the resulting AIR file built with Flex 4 SDK 11873.

Spark Button skin has a curious minWidth and minHeight Found in 4.0.0.11851.Steps to reproduce:1. Open the default Spark Button skin:http://opensource.adobe.com/svn/opensource/flex/sdk/trunk/frameworks/projects/spark/src/spark/skins/spark/ButtonSkin.mxml2. Note the minWidth and minHeight (minWidth="21" minHeight="21")3. Compile and run attached MXML file and observe the Button's reported default width/height.Actual Results:Skin's specified minWidth and minHeight are 21px.Skin's actual default width is 70px wide by 21px high.  Expected Results:Default Spark Button size should be a lot smaller. This can cause issues if you have a Button with a very small label and it still takes up 70px.Workaround (if any):Create your own Button skin and dont use default. Explicitly resize all Button controls if you know they will have small labels.I *think* this is due to the following code in the default Spark Button skin:    <!-- layer 7: border - put on top of the fill so it doesn't disappear when scale is less than 1 -->    <s:Rect id="border" left="0" right="0" top="0" bottom="0" width="69" height="20" radiusX="2">Note that the Button skin's default minWidth is set to 21, yet this border's width is hardcoded at 69?!-----<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><!-- SparkSkinning/ASTyleSelectorLoadExample.mxml --><mx:Application xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"                xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/halo"                xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark">        <s:Panel id="pnl" x="20" y="20" creationComplete="pnl.title = btn.width.toString() + 'x' + btn.height.toString();">        <s:Button id="btn" />    </s:Panel>    </mx:Application> Bug Spark Button skin has a curious minWidth and minHeight Found in 4.0.0.11851.Steps to reproduce:1.

ToggleButtonBar loses selectedIndex upon COLLECTION_CHANGE of dataProvider Steps to reproduce:1. Create a ToggleButtonBar, and assign it with a dataProvider and a selectedIndex2. Change a property of one of the items in the dataProvider Actual Results: selectedIndex is reset to -1  Expected Results: selectedIndex is not reset  Workaround (if any): Extend ToggleButtonBar to cache selectedIndex in a local property when either dataProvider or selectedIndex is set, and restore it in an overridden commitProperties. NOTE:  This behavior might be correct if the entire dataProvider was changing, rather than an object within it.  Perhaps the handler for collectionChanged should be improved to retain the selectedIndex. Bug ToggleButtonBar loses selectedIndex upon COLLECTION_CHANGE of dataProvider Steps to reproduce:1.

variableRowHeight="true" and rowHeight="10" can co-exist without compile warning This is replica of FB-24006.Steps to reproduce: [The issue was found on Flash Builder compiled from latest source code on Nov 11, 2009.] 1. create a Flex Project, and add a <s:Panel> component to the project; 2. In Design view, set the Panel with VerticalLayout; 3. In PI Category view, under category "Layout", set variableRowHeight with value "true" and rowHeight with a number value "10"; 4. Switch to Source view, note the Panel's <s:VerticalLayout> element has attributes variableRowHeight="true" and rowHeight="10"; 5. Save the source file to trigger a compilation.    Actual Results:  - no compile error or warning is generated    Expected Results:  - when variableRowHeight has value "true", rowHeight should not be set; or when rowHeight has non-empty value, variableRowHeight should be "false" . When invalid value pair co-exist, it would be nice to show compile warning to user.

SliderDataTip instantiates it's border class before it's style can be set by Slider. Steps to reproduce:1. Define a style for a Slider (HSlider or VSlider) and define a dataTipStyleName.2. Define the data tip style and define a borderSkin for it.3. Create a Slider (HSlider or VSlider).Slider creates and styles it's SliderDataTip during it's onThumbPress method. SliderDataTip (or more accurately it's super class: ToolTip) creates and styles it's border during it's createChildren method. The border is being created and styled before Slider applies any different style name, and never subsequently has it's style updated. Actual Results: The Slider will ignore the borderSkin style and use the default ToolTipBorder.  Expected Results: The Slider should use the borderSkin defined by it's data tip style.  Workaround (if any): Define a component style for SliderDataTip and change as needed. Bug SliderDataTip instantiates it's border class before it's style can be set by Slider. Steps to reproduce:1.
