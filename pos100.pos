[CTFXG 2512007] FXGUtils and MXML-G compilation are inserting extra newlines into the generated SWF If you compile this with FXGUtils or MXML-C then you'll see that there is an extra newline before the word 'Double'.At first we thought this was a Flamingo problem with not including the newline between <content> and <p> but she says Flamingo correctly drops this and that the whitespace handling rules state:Basically, the rule being applied in this case is that whitespace which would require both an implicit p and an implicit span is dropped. So the newline and  spaces between <content> and <p> are dropped and the newline and spaces between </p> and </content> are dropped.  Therefore this is working as designed, per the requirements documents.Regardless of whether whiteSpaceCollapse has the 'collapse' or 'preserve' value, every sequence of characters between (not within) explicit <p>...</p> tags that is all whitespace is removed; no implied <p> or <span> is generated for them. In the XML DOM sense, every text node that is a direct child of the <text> [content] parent that is all whitespace is removed.You can look at her notes directly in the Flamingo bug in this bug group.

Impossible to set AxisRenderer's axisStroke style from CSS The axisStroke, minorTickStroke, and tickStroke styles on AxisRenderer are of type IStroke.  There doesn't seem to be a way to set these from CSS.  If they can't be set from CSS then should they be styles?  Perhaps like other strokes throughout the framework the AxisRenderer should expose things like tickStrokeColor and tickStrokeWeight.

Flex 4: frameRate stays at 1 after the app. comes back to foregound. This bug is first reported as AIR bug (Watson 2495973). But the problem is in Flex SDK.Steps to reproduce:1. Install and Run the the AIR app. in the Bug Files tab.2. Launch another AIR app using ADL(download the files from Bug Files tab): adl  DebugCrash-app.xml3. Exit the AIR app. launched by ADL.4. Goes back the running AIR app. in step 0.  Actual Results: Consistently: After terminating the debug session - cursor movement performance is very poor (jumpy)Inconsistently: Functionality of app will change (rectangle tool fails to work)  Expected Results: ADL debug sessions not to affect concurrently running release application functionality of performance  Workaround (if any): Copy over the most important note from the AIR bug:achicu; 12/08/2009 08:54 AMI've decompiled Muse.air and I think I've found the issue. It isn't a bug in AIR.There's a new feature in Flex 4 which sets the frameRate to 1 when the application is in background. Flex 4 adds two events listener in the WindowedApplication constructor: one for "activate" and one for "deactivate". However, in this case Flex 4 is not designed to have 2 x WindowedApplications at the same time. Because of that Muse gets two "deactivation" dispatches which saves the old frameRate and sets the stage.frameRate to 1. When the second "deactivation" is called, it will save the "1" frameRate and set the new frameRate to 1. From now on, the frameRate is always 1.The behavior is only visible in the installed application because the second WindowedApplication is only created in the installed application. The second WindowedApplication comes from the ApplicationUpdaterUI.This bug should be fixed in the Flex Framework. It adds listeners on NativeApplication which is a singleton from WindowedApplication which doesn't seems to be a singleton. I think there should be something like a FrameRateManager singleton that does this frameRate adaptation.This is the decompiled code from MuseOnAIRif (!Capabilities.isDebugger){  updateApp();};private function updateApp():void{            var appUpdater:* = null;            var onUpdateInit:* = null;            var onUpdateError:* = null;            onUpdateInit = function (_arg1:Event):void{                appUpdater.checkNow();            };            onUpdateError = function (_arg1:ErrorEvent):void{            };            appUpdater = new ApplicationUpdaterUI();            appUpdater.updateURL = "http://urania.sea.adobe.com/MuseUpdate/update.xml";            appUpdater.isCheckForUpdateVisible = false;            appUpdater.addEventListener(ErrorEvent.ERROR, onUpdateError);            appUpdater.addEventListener(UpdateEvent.INITIALIZED, onUpdateInit);            appUpdater.initialize();        } Bug Flex 4: frameRate stays at 1 after the app. comes back to foregound.

Increasing the Width of Thumb Image decreases the length of track Slider  as compared to the default length of Slider - HSlider Issue Description : I have extended the SliderThumb class and set the this.width and height as 79 and 20 resp for using the big Thumb on HSlider in flex  But if I use the thumbClass in HSlider as    <mx:HSlider id="slider2" width="450" showDataTip="false" snapInterval="1" liveDragging="true"  showTrackHighlight="true" sliderThumbClass="BigThumbClass"  />Then the slider rendered is shorter in length as compared to default size [rendered with 20X20 default].  [As shown in error_snapshot.jpg].Steps to reproduce:1. I have added the needed files and image which can show how the behavior affects and restricts the user to use the Wide Thumb Image if needed on track Slider as then the track Slider is shorter than the default one .2. Just extract the attached src folder into new Flex Project , and run the mxml file.3. Attachment contains the following :  a)  src folder of the project :            -  assets folder  : contains the image for the slider           -  BigThumbClass.as  -- extended SliderThumb class           - CustomSilderComparison.mxml - main file   b) error_snapshot.jpg   ::  the behavior snapshot , comparing the Default Slider and Custom Slider.    Actual Results:   The custom slider  is decreasing the length of Slider with increase in the width of image of thumb.  Expected Results:   The custom slider  should not decrease the length of Slider.  The track Slider should relatively adjust its length with the width increase in Thumb Image .  Workaround (if any): None that I know.

Report.contentUpdated() returns false when new file is added to included source path when compiling a swc Steps to reproduce:1. Create a new library project in FB2. Create a package and add a class to it3. Make sure Build Automatically is ON and swc is compiled4. Copy and past the class into same package5. Give file a new name when it asks you to rename it ==> project is not rebuilt now, should be though, and you should get an error saying the filename in the pasted class does not match class name in the code6. touch the original class file (a space or any save will do)Now the swc is re-compiled. It should have been compiled after the new class was created since the project is compiled with -include-sources and the entire source folder. The problem is that Report.contentUpdated() returns false when a new file is created in an included source folder.   Expected Results:   Workaround (if any): clean and rebuild when adding files.

ASDoc not saving event type for [Bindable] metadata tag The getter for the UIComponent.x property is preceded by a [Bindable] metadata tag with an event type:    [Bindable("xChanged")]However, that event type is not being written to the DITA XML of the ASDoc output.

DataGroup leaks ItemRenderers when layout.useVirtualLayout=true and itemRendererFunction != null Steps to reproduce:DataGroup adds ItemRenderers to its internal free list when recycling isn't possible, notably when itemRendererFunction != null.  If dataProvider.length is large, this is a significant memory leak.The attached application demonstrates the problem.  Monitor the application's heap size with TaskManager and slowly scroll from one end to the other.   Actual Results: Memory usage grows without bounds.   Expected Results: Memory usage peaks after a few seconds and is held in check by the GC.

Sub-application loads an RSL into the wrong ApplicationDomain Steps to reproduce:1. Import the three attached Flash Builder projects. The projects are for AppA, AppB, and CustomFoo. AppA is top level application. AppA loads the framework RSL (but no other RSLs) and AppB. AppB loads the CustomFoo RSL (and no other RSLs). The SDK default for these projects was "Merged into code". If your default is "RSL" then you should change the framework linkage in AppA and AppB to "Merged into Code".2. Run AppA in the debugger.3. Click the "AppA test for MyFoo" button. "MyFoo" is a class in the CustomFoo RSL and so should not be seen by AppA. In the console window you wil see "Is MyFoo class available = false" which is correct.4. Click the "load AppB" button.5. Click the "AppA test for MyFoo" button.  Actual Results: In the console window you wil see "Is MyFoo class available = true". This is incorrect. The CustomFoo RSL should be loaded into AppB's application domain, not AppA's application domain.  Expected Results: "Is MyFoo class available = false".

Error #1009 Due to null focusManager in RichEditableText/addActivateHandlers Steps to reproduce:The root cause of the exception is that there is the RichEditableText (RET) has no focusManager and therefore fails since no check is made to ensure that a focusManager exists.  There are several scenarios in which this could occur including the provided test case (RET_RTE.mxml) in which the component used for the popup does not implement the IFocusManagerContainer interface.

CLONE -Intermittent but easily reproducible internal compiler error in simple mxml project when you save before previous compile is done This is Windows only; I couldn't reproduce on Mac.Steps to reproduce:1. Make a new Flex project2. Add an <fx:Script> block3. In the <fx:Script> block, repeatedly and quickly do edit, save, edit, save, edit, save, over and over again.  For example, the way I reproduced was by just inserting a semicolon and then pressing Ctrl-S to save, over and over.  (If you wait too long between saves, the bug will not reproduce; you have to be fast.  Don't wait for the previous compile to finish.)

[CTFXG 2504185] MXML Graphics doesn't deal with alpha on group with default blendMode properly For the attached FXG file, FXGUtils and MXML-G compilation are different. FXGUtils is wrong.The FXG 2.0 spec stays that groups with normal blendMode and an alpha > 0 and < 1 should propogate the alpha to the children instead of treating the alpha as on the group.The wording from the spec is:When alpha is set on a grouping element whose blend mode is "normal", it acts as if the children of the group had their alphas individually set. This is different from the standard behavior of the CS tools, in which the alpha applies to the entire group, not to the individual children. Because of this somewhat nonstandard behavior, we define a special blendMode, "auto", for groups, which acts as blendMode="normal" when the alpha of the group is 0 or 1, and blendMode="layer" when the alpha of the group is strictly between 0 and 1. When a group does not have a specific blendMode, and its static appearance would be the same whether the blendMode is "normal" or "layer" (e.g. because no children have blendModes that require blending against items outside the group), we recommend using blendMode="auto".

RSLs unneccarily loaded multiple times and then unloaded multiple times I checked the source code for 4.0 and it seems that this hasn't been addressed there either so I'm changing the 'Found in Version'.Create two sub-applications and one main application that use the same RSL.  Then load both sub-applications and see that even though the RSL was loaded by the main application it is still loaded for each sub-application.  If done enough times then the unneeded RSLs will unload.  Actual Results: The same RSL is loaded multiple times.  Expected Results: Each RSL should only be loaded once.  The RSLListLoader should check to see if the RSL has already been loaded.  Workaround (if any): Update RSLListLoader to track what has been loaded and skip requests if the RSL isn't already loaded.

When setting the scaleX and scaleY properties to LinkBar, labels get truncated in some cases Steps to reproduce:1. Set the ScaleX and ScaleY property of LinkBar to 0.8 i.e. value less than 0.9, after running the application you will observe  that few labels get truncated in some cases.2. Now change the ScaleX and ScaleY of LinkBar to  "1", after running the application you will observe that no labels get truncated now.   Actual Results: LinkButton's textWidth in UITextField gets truncated when using value of ScaleX below 0.9 .  Expected Results: LinkButton's textWidth in UITextField should not truncate the characters, it should resize the text in the available textWidth.
